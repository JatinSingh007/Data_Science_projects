The Customer Churn Prediction Model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a sophisticated machine learning solution designed to forecast whether customers are likely to leave a service or product. By leveraging the power of ANN, a subset of artificial intelligence, this model learns complex patterns from historical customer data. It considers various factors such as tenure, usage patterns, customer demographics, and interactions. Through multiple layers of interconnected neurons, the ANN processes these inputs, adapts its weights, and ultimately produces predictions with a high level of accuracy. The model empowers businesses to proactively identify customers at risk of churning, enabling them to take targeted actions and implement retention strategies, ultimately preserving customer loyalty and enhancing business profitability.
