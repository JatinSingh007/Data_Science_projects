## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for the prediction of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a common and potentially life-threatening respiratory infection, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Introduction
Pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory infection that can affect people of all ages. It often manifests in chest X-ray images as opacities or infiltrations in the lungs. This project aims to provide a tool for automating the detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images using machine learning.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate our pneumonia detection model, we used a publicly available dataset of chest X-ray images. You can find more information about the dataset and access it
