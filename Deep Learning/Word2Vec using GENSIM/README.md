# Word2Vec with Gensim

## Installation
Before you can use Gensim and Word2Vec, you need to install the Gensim library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

!pip3 install gensim

## Import Gensim and Prepare Your Data

To get started, you'll need a corpus of text data. First, import Gensim and prepare your text data by tokenizing it into sentences and words.

## Training the Word2Vec Model
Once you have your data prepared, you can train the Word2Vec model using your sentences.

## Using the Trained Word Vectors
After training, you can use the trained Word2Vec model to obtain word vectors for words in your vocabulary.

## Saving and Loading the Model
You can save the trained Word2Vec model for future use and load it later.

## Fine-Tuning and Model Parameters
You can fine-tune the Word2Vec model by adjusting parameters like vector_size, window, min_count, and more. Experiment with these parameters to achieve the best results for your specific task.
